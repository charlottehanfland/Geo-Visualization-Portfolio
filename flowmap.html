		        <p> Justification of your flow map design. Please refer to the references to justify your choice
of flow map symbology, including the point symbols, flow symbols, and the background
choropleth map. Justify the choice of your node, flow and choropleth symbology, which
should be different than the maps published in FlowMapper article and the tutorial video.
I attempted a diverging color scheme for the choropleth map to show the divide between
net population gain and loss, however Flow Mapper’s manual classification and color
scheme choices didn’t allow a “zero flow” class or a perfect even split between negative
flow classes and positive flow classes. I settled for a color scheme where blue shades
would represent no to very little flows and red shades would represent greater net flows
as this was still somewhat intuitive. I chose solid color flow symbols on the
recommendation of one of the reference papers and chose a purple color scheme. The
purple color had the greatest differentiation between migration flow classes and stood
out well against the choropleth map colors. There may be some issues of simultaneous
contrast in the middle of the map, but purple is still the better and most discernible color
in this case.
                </p>
                <p> 
I manually classified the nodes to show major classes in the data and chose to keep the
black circle symbology for ease of interpretation.
Interpretation of flow patterns. Discuss:
Oklahoma attracts the most major migration flows, which makes sense considering it sees
the greatest net migration as shown in the choropleth map. Missouri, Oklahoma, and
Texas have the greatest total flows with significant movement going to, from, and between
the three states. Most of the movement appears to be towards neighboring states with
very few migration flows going across several states. California is the only notable
exception to this as it too receives flows from Missouri. There’s a slight westward trend,
however most of the movement activity is happening in the Midwest and the South. The
choropleth map shows the greatest population growth occurring in the west, but the most
movement is happening in those previously mentioned areas.
Many of the states appear to have balanced migration inflow and outflows despite seeing
net migration outflow. This is most likely attributed to how net migration and migration
flows are classified and would be an important consideration in future flow maps.
